## README

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to enable users to draw rectangles on an RGB image (sample_RGB.png) and simultaneously visualize the corresponding depth information. The drawn rectangles' pixel intensities are analyzed, and key statistics such as average intensity and standard deviation are displayed in real-time on the RGB image. This script was just used to quickly assess the depth values by inspection.

### Quick Instructions:
Place your RGB image as sample_RGB.png and the corresponding depth image as corres_depth.png in the same directory as the script.

Run the script, and a window named "RGB" will appear.

Click and drag to draw rectangles on the RGB image. The script will display real-time statistics of the pixel intensities within the drawn rectangles.

Press the 'Esc' key to exit the program.
